This repository contains implementation of Dynamic Programming Algorithms using Javascript

Dynamic Programming (DP) is defined as a technique that solves some particular type of problems in Polynomial Time. Dynamic Programming solutions are faster than the exponential brute method

The Problems include:
1. The Coin Change Problem.
2. The modified Fibonacci series
